Let's step through the isValid helper function I created. 

It receives 2 parameters: id and model. This lets me use it for any model. 

3 total lines inside the function:
Set the id on the model
Call the read_single method from the model
Return the result

This helper (aka utility) function comes in handy. It's the only one I created in this project. 

This will let you confirm something exists before trying to modify it.
